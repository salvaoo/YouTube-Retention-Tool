## Vaxxed Doggos - YouTube Retention Tool

YouTubers are always looking for ways to improve their content. Two things are important to determine if a video is going to go viral or not: click-through rate and watch time. Today, weâ€™re going to be building an app that helps YouTubers create better videos by showing them which parts of their videos are the most engaging for their audience.

## Localhost config

First, download the project: 
```bash 
git clone https://github.com/salvaoo/YouTube-Retention-Tool---Hackathon.git
```

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
